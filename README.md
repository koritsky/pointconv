# PointConv (refactoring)
## Introduction
This repository contatins a refactoring of the [original PointConv repository](https://github.com/DylanWusee/pointconv) of the paper [_PointConv: Deep Convolutional Networks on 3D Point Clouds_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07246). Work on this project was done as part of the Skoltech course [Foundations of Software Engeneering](https://github.com/artonson/skoltech_fse_v2021.1).
